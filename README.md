MidNight-Craves :
MidNight Craves is a concept website for a late-night food delivery platform that helps you discover curated restaurants, browse menus, and place orders when the cravings hit after dark. The experience focuses on a dramatic hero header, handpicked restaurant highlights, and a simple flow that takes a guest from curiosity to checkout in just a few clicks.

Highlights :
- Immersive hero section with dual call-to-action buttons that adapt once a visitor signs in.
- Featured restaurant carousel with cuisine tags, ratings, and quick access to menus.
- Guided “How it works” section that explains the four-step ordering journey.
- Responsive login form that stores the guest’s name in localStorage and personalizes the navbar greeting.
- Dedicated restaurant discovery and menu pages with search and filter controls ready for data integration.

Pages :
- index.html – Landing page with hero content, featured restaurants, workflow, and contact footer.
- login.html – Lightweight authentication mock that captures first name, last name, and email.
- restaurant.html – Restaurant explorer with search bar, cuisine filters, and detailed cards.
- menu.html – Menu/search layout that reuses the restaurant styling for a consistent experience.

Tech Stack :
- HTML5 for semantic structure and SVG-based iconography.
- Vanilla CSS (home.css, login.css, restaurant.css) for custom layout, typography, and responsive components.
- Vanilla JavaScript (home.js, login.js) for lightweight interactions such as local personalization and navigation changes.

Future Improvements :
- Replace hard-coded restaurant cards with dynamic data from an API.
- Implement real authentication and order tracking.
- Add cart state management and payment summaries on the menu page.
